# Living Lyrics 🎮✨

**Living Lyrics** is an interactive typing and physics-based word game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** using the [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) physics engine.  
Type letters to bring them to life with dynamic physics, glowing effects, and themed animations — or challenge yourself in **Marathon Mode** to test your speed, accuracy, and combos.
